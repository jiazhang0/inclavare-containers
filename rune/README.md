# rune

`rune` is a CLI tool for spawning and running enclaves in containers according to the OCI specification.

?? The codebase of `rune` is a fork of [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc), so `rune` can be used as `runc` if enclave is not configured or available.

# Building

`rune` currently supports the Linux platform with x86-64 architecture only. It must be built with Go version 1.14 or higher.

`rune` depends on protobuf compiler. Please refer to [this step](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf#protocol-compiler-installation) to install it on your platform. Additionally, `rune` by default enables seccomp support as [runc](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc#building) so you need to install libseccomp on your platform.

```bash
# create $WORKSPACE folder
mkdir -p "$WORKSPACE"
cd "$WORKSPACE"
git clone https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers
cd inclavare-containers/rune

# install Go protobuf plugin for protobuf 3
go get github.com/golang/protobuf/protoc-gen-go@v1.3.5

# build and install rune
make
sudo make install
```

`rune` will be installed to `/usr/local/sbin/rune` on your system.

# Using rune

## How to launch rune

`rune` is OCI Runtime specification compatible container engine. It can be integrated with containerd and docker.

Please refer to [these steps](README.md#) for the integration guide.

## What can be launched by rune

In the downstream of `rune`, various enclave runtimes can be launched by `rune` through well-defined [Enclave Runtime PAL API](rune/libenclave/internal/runtime/pal/spec.md).

### Skeleton
Skeleton is an example of enclave runtime, interfacing with Enclave Runtime PAL API for easy interfacing with `rune`.  Skeleton sample code is helpful to write your own enclave runtime.

Please refer to [this tutorial](rune/libenclave/internal/runtime/pal/skeleton/README.md) for more details.

### Occlum



# Developement

## Running OCI bundle

Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/blob/master/docs/running_rune_with_occlum_bundle.md) to run `occlum bundle` with `rune`.

Taking Occlum as example.

## Create container image

Please refer to [this guide](https://github.com/alibaba/inclavare-containers/blob/master/docs/running_rune_with_occlum.md) to build the Occlum application container image.

## Creating an OCI bundle
In order to use `rune` you must have your container image in the format of an OCI bundle. If you have Docker installed you can use its `export` method to acquire a root filesystem from an existing Occlum application container image. 

```shell
# create the top most bundle directory
mkdir -p "$HOME/rune_workdir" 
cd "$HOME/rune_workdir"
mkdir rune-container
cd rune-container

# create the rootfs directory
mkdir rootfs

# export Occlum application image via Docker into the rootfs directory
docker export $(docker create ${Occlum_application_image}) | sudo tar -C rootfs -xvf -
```

After a root filesystem is populated you just generate a spec in the format of a config.json file inside your bundle. `rune` provides a spec command which is similar to `runc` to generate a template file that you are then able to edit.

```shell
rune spec
```

To find features and documentation for fields in the spec please refer to the [specs](https://github.com/opencontainers/runtime-spec) repository.

In order to run the hello world demo program in Occlum with `rune`, you need to change the entrypoint from `sh` to `/bin/hello_world`
``` json
  "process": {
      "args": [
          "/bin/hello_world"
      ],
  }
```

and then configure enclave runtime as following:
``` json
  "annotations": {
      "enclave.type": "intelSgx",
      "enclave.runtime.path": "/opt/occlum/build/lib/libocclum-pal.so.0.15.1",
      "enclave.runtime.args": "./"
  }
```

where:
- @enclave.type: specify the type of enclave hardware to use, such as `intelSgx`.
- @enclave.runtime.path: specify the path to enclave runtime to launch. For an Occlum application, you need to specify the path to `libocclum-pal.so`.
- @enclave.runtime.args: specify the specific arguments to enclave runtime, separated by the comma.

## Run Occlum application
Assuming you have an OCI bundle from the previous step you can execute the container in this way.

```shell
cd "$HOME/rune_workdir/rune-container"
sudo rune run ${Occlum_application_container_name}
```
